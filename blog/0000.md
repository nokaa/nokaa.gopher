## Rust Web Servers

I have been experimenting with using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org)
for writing web servers. I enjoy doing low level programming, so I have
not explored much of the work that has gone on in this area with Rust,
such as [Nickel](https://github.com/nickel-org/nickel.rs) and
[Iron](https://github.com/iron/iron). I have instead opted to use
[rotor-http](https://github.com/tailhook/rotor-http). Using rotor-http
poses some challenges, as it is _very_ barebones. As an example, when a
form is submitted, we are given a byte array, which required writing a
parser to utilize this data.

I have previously worked with [Golang](https://golang.org); mostly
writing webservers. Working with Rust has been a completely different
experience. As an example, in Golang if I wish to redirect a user, I
can do something like `http.Redirect(w, r, "/", 302)`. In Rust I wrote
this function:

```Rust
pub fn redirect(res: &mut Response, data: &[u8], location: &[u8], code: u16)
    -> Result<(), String>
{
    let message = match code_lookup(code) {
        Some(m) => m,
        None => return Err("Code not found!".to_string()),
    };

    res.status(code, message);
    res.add_header("Location", location).unwrap();
    res.add_length(data.len() as u64).unwrap();
    if res.done_headers().unwrap() {
        res.write_body(data);
    }
    res.done();
}
```
