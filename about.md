# nokaa

Hi, I'm nokaa.
I'm a hobbyist programmer with a big interest in programming languages
and systems programming.

I enjoy working with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) and
[Go](https://golang.org).

You can view my work on [my git server](https://git.nokaa.moe/nokaa).
I sometimes contribute to projects hosted on
[GitHub](https://github.com/nokaa).

I'm a Free Software advocate and a staunch supporter of freedom of
speech and the right to privacy.

I sometimes watch Chinese cartoons.

You can email me at _nokaa@cock.li_.
My [gpg key](https://nokaa.moe/gpg.txt) is available.
I am usually on freenode and irc.mozilla.org as _nokaa_.

I have a [blog](https://nokaa.moe/blog), where I occasionally rant.
I also have a [gopher server](gopher://nokaa.moe).
